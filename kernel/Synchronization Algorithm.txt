IPC Clients :

- The "Ipc Client Thread" is a kernel thread that dispatches ipc communications to avoid 
  multiprocessor unsynchronized behaviour

- This thread will have a dynamic priority based on the length of the pending messages

- Each Client have an inMessageQueue (Received Messages) and an outMessageQueue (Asynchronous 
  Pending Messages to be dispatched by the IpcClientThread)
